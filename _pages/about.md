My name is Haruki Matsui, and I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Civil and Earth Resources Engineering at Kyoto University. I belong to the [River Disaster Prevention Systems (Kawaike Lab)](https://rcfcd.dpri.kyoto-u.ac.jp/rdps/default.html), where my research focuses on urban flood modeling, with a particular emphasis on pluvial flooding. Mt academic interests lie in the field of hydraulics and disaster prevention engineering, and I committed to developing methods that contribute to more effective flood risk manegiment in urban environment.

Research
------
Pluvial flooding caused by heavy rainfall exceeding drainage capacity is becoming more frequent across Japan, with concerns about further intensification due to climate change. To support nationwide flood risk assessment, we need a versatile and accurate simulation model. However, two major challenges hinder its development: (1) inconsistent sewer data across cities, and (2) complex, city-specific drainage systems.

My research addresses these challenges by building a unified analytical framework. I apply graph theory to open data to generate virtual sewer networks and integrate them with existing datasets. I also improve simulation stability by introducing a time-adaptive scheme to a coupled 1D–2D flood model, which captures detailed drainage behavior.

This framework reduces modeling effort and enables the evaluation of urban flood risks under future climate scenarios, contributing to more effective flood resilience planning across Japan.
