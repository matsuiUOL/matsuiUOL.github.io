My name is Haruki Matsui, and I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Civil and Earth Resources Engineering at Kyoto University. I belong to the [River Disaster Prevention Systems (Kawaike Lab)](https://rcfcd.dpri.kyoto-u.ac.jp/rdps/default.html), where my research focuses on urban flood modeling, with a particular emphasis on pluvial flooding. Mt academic interests lie in the field of hydraulics and disaster prevention engineering, and I committed to developing methods that contribute to more effective flood risk manegiment in urban environment.
